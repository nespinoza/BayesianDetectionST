Bayesian Detection of Single Transits
-------------------------------------

The `generate_lcs.py` code generates file of the form `sim_10_1000_100`. First number is by how much the original dataset has been trimmed (in this case, 10 is a factor of 10 --- if you had 1000 datapoints, this covers only the central 100 datapoints). Next is the lightcurve precision (1000 ppm in this case); and final number is the transit depth of the injected transit in ppm (100 ppm in this case).
